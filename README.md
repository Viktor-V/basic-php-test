Please, complete following tasks:
1. Set up DB using provided mysql dump file. You may use provided docker-compose.yml if you like. But docker knowledge is not required.
2. Create a script to generate a JSON file, containing a nested `items_categories` data. Only `ID` and `name` fields are required in export.
3. Create a script to generate an Excel file, containing `items_categories` data. Only `ID` and `name` fields are required in export. Data hierarchy should be visualized.

*There is install.php script present, which was used to generate test-data. This script somewhat represents current state of codebase (sql.php is actually a part of a current system).*
